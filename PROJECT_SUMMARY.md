## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### Core Smart Contract Features
- **Message Verification**: ECDSA signature verification with trusted relayers
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based system preventing message replay attacks
- **Access Control**: Owner-managed trusted relayer system
- **Security Guards**: Reentrancy protection, message expiration, payload limits
- **Gas Optimization**: Calldata parameters, custom errors, efficient storage

### Security Mechanisms Implemented
1. **Trusted Relayer System**: Only authorized relayers can submit messages
2. **Sequential Nonces**: Prevents replay attacks and ensures message ordering
3. **Message Expiration**: 1-hour validity window prevents stale messages
4. **Signature Verification**: ECDSA signatures ensure authenticity
5. **Reentrancy Protection**: OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
6. **Payload Size Limits**: DoS protection with 10KB max payload

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Gas Usage Analysis
| Operation | Gas Cost | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Contract Deployment | ~1,020,316 | One-time cost |
| Message Processing | ~207,861 | Including target execution |
| Add Relayer | ~47,373 | Admin operation |
| Enable Chain | ~46,947 | Admin operation |

### Test Coverage
- ✅ **14 passing tests** covering all critical functionality
- ✅ **Security edge cases** (replay attacks, unauthorized access)
- ✅ **Gas optimization verification**
- ✅ **Error handling and validation**

## 🔒 Security Analysis

### Implemented Protections
- **Replay Attack Prevention**: Nonce tracking with processed message mapping
- **Signature Forgery Protection**: ECDSA verification with trusted relayers
- **Reentrancy Protection**: OpenZeppelin's battle-tested ReentrancyGuard
- **Access Control**: Owner-only sensitive operations
- **DoS Prevention**: Payload size limits and gas optimization

### Trade-off Analysis
**Chosen: Trusted Relayers vs Merkle Proofs**
- ✅ **Lower Gas Costs**: ~50k vs ~150k gas for Merkle proofs
- ✅ **Faster Finality**: No need to wait for block finalization
- ✅ **Implementation Simplicity**: Easier to debug and maintain
- ❌ **Centralization Risk**: Requires trusted relayer infrastructure
